# What do I want the language to be:
# Simple, easy to add to, (simpler than C if possible)
# easy to understand
# not limited, no external code generation if possible, templates, metaprogramming, etc.
# a LISP seems like the right route, but I don't really know.
# I can use macros and objects to make templates without using comptime really.
# macros will be more full featured, like LISP, and they will be typechecked at least.
# there may still be a form of comptime if for bools and such.
# also 

# let's modify reverse polish notation so that it puts the result into veriables
